todo for MVP MR:
1. add tests to make sure presolved (done!) and one unsolved puzzle are in redis at end (done!)
2. setup logic to append newly solved puzzles to specified csv (puzzles.csv by default)
2. test that solved/tests.csv gets a valid new puzzle added
2. test that solved/tests.csv does not get already solved puzzle duplicate added
2. generate puzzles.csv with all solved (should take < 1 hr w/ 8 threads)
3. change default puzzle file to none (see todo at end of start.ts)
4. update README including repo level todos and link to v1 tag (repo todos include recreating export and difficulty report and whatnot)
5. delete old code
6. update version
7. make MR
